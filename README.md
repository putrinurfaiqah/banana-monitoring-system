# banana-monitoring-system
The Smart Banana Quality Tracking and Monitoring System is a comprehensive solution that uses an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring, and an MQ2 sensor for gas detection to ensure optimal storage conditions. 
 It includes a buzzer and LED indicators for real-time alerts, displays data on an LCD screen, and uploads readings to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring, helping to reduce waste and improve the efficiency of banana distribution.
